# Claude-3 Opus: AI Evolution

## Overview
Claude-3 Opus: AI Evolution is a machine learning project designed to explore the capabilities of neural networks in evolving and adapting to various datasets. The project utilizes a configurable neural network architecture and training parameters to optimize performance across different types of data.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The project uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) to set model parameters, data handling, and logging settings. Here's a brief overview of the configuration options:

- `model_params`: Defines the neural network architecture and training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- `data_params`: Settings for data shuffling and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
- `paths`: File paths for training data, test data, and where to save the trained model.
- `logging`: Configuration for logging level and log file path.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will:
- Set up logging.
- Ensure necessary directories exist.
- Prepare the data.
- Initialize the model and optimizer.
- Train the model.
- Save the trained model to the specified path.

## Project Structure

- `config.json`: Configuration file for model parameters and data handling.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for loading configurations and setting up logging.
- `data_loader.py`: Functions to load and preprocess data.
- `model.py`: Contains the neural network model and functions to get the model and optimizer.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in `requirements.txt` to avoid any issues during runtime.

## Logging

Logs are written to `logs/training.log` as specified in the configuration file. Adjust the log level in `config.json` if needed.
